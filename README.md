Move around the map to avoid the increasing number of enemies for as long as possible. Look out for powerups and beware of enemy variants! This is a work-in-progress.
You are the last Circle of Mages. Protect the Tower at all costs! Randomized upgrades, build paths, and more enemy variants in development!

It is currently playable if you have the Pygame library installed (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
I will be packaging it into an executable file once I have added sprite artwork assets.
