You are the last Circle of Mages. Protect the Tower at all costs! Randomized upgrades, build paths, and more enemy variants in development!

It is currently playable if you have the Pygame library installed (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).
I will be packaging it into an executable file once I have added sprite artwork assets.
Thank you for your interest!
