Move around the map to avoid the increasing number of enemies for as long as possible. Look out for powerups and beware of enemy variants! This is a work-in-progress.

It is currently playable if you have the Pygame library installed (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). I will be packaging it into an executable file once I have added sprite artwork assets. Thank you for your interest!
